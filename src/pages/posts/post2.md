description: 'Thanks to Majorana 1, a new research paper has been published with the answer that many physicist
              where trying to find for almost 20 years. Not only the possibility of creating (a thing that was only
              theorized by Ettore Majorana, famous italian physicist) a new state of matter but using that same new
              state to build a brand new quantum computer that is able to decrease significantly the number of errors
              in quantum measurements and calculations.'
